### About the Project
This project is a creation of the Bitter Aloe Project Team and their commitment towards visualizing testimonies of the  atrocities of apartheid South Africa. The goal of this project is to present a 3D space reminiscent of a South African landscape, with markers (Bitter Aloe Plants), that share testimony data from South Africa's Truth and Reconcialiation Commission (TRC) archive. The project is made with Unity and designed by University of Kentucky Computer Science students as part of their CS499 Senior Design Class.
