    an Essa Madikiri - we were at this persons house and  this person said that there
    were problems at Sohnge and some of the people at Sohnge wanted to boycott and
    others didn't want to boycott.\nWe then all decided that on the next day, the
    20th August which was also the birthday of the UDF that we would all go there
    and that all three schools would march towards the Sohnge College.  That was
    the Worcester Secondary School as well as the Breede River Secondary School and
    they all came together at the third school and from there we marched with the
    various placards to the Sohnge College.\nWhen we arrived at the Sohnge College 
    we deputised some people to meet  with the SRC of Sohnge College.  And while
    we were busy with this meeting we saw the Riot Squad arriving outside and they
    were all gathering around outside.  We immediately adjourned the meeting.  Sohnge
    SRC could not make a decision whether they were going to boycott or not so on
    that day when we came out of the meeting at Sohnge College, the officer in charge
    of the police at that time spoke to us over the bull horn - the loud hailer and
    then he told us that we only had 10 minutes to disperse and to return to our
    schools.\nA few seconds later - not even 10 minutes later as we were granted,
    having refused to leave there he gave a signal with his finger, he just dropped
    his finger and then the first person who shot that day and that person is also
    in this hall today and I am going to mention his name and that is Captain Willis,
    he is a Captain today,  he has a rank, today he has stars on his shoulder and
    I got nowhere in life because of what they did.  \nOn that day he shot the first
    tear gas canister and they also shot with rubber bullets and we were all chased
    apart like wild animals.  They chased us from Sohnge College, most of the school
    children ran behind Sohnge College and if you go up to the old Sohnge College
    building, if you behind it, you'll see that there is a cemetery and we had to
    run there through the cemetery to escape from the police.\nI ran into the New
    Hope Centre, which was a new building of theirs in Leopard Avenue, behind the
    school and most of the school children ran back to Esselen Park Secondary School. 
    We were about 3,000 schoolchildren who were at Sohnge College that day.  Our
    parents were standing outside when the boers -  the police started shooting on
    us.\",../data/data_saha\\human_rights_violation_hearings\\worcester\\56171.json,23,https://sabctrc.saha.org.za/documents/hrvtrans/worcester/56171.htm,33,Human

    PEDRO,\"I must mention that I was arrested on the Saturday morning the 15th of
    August, on the 16th of August I arrived in Cape Town - that was the Sunday because
    they drove me down to Cape Town overnight.  I didn't sleep at all that night,
    I was also a little bit hungry.  Whilst I was being interrogated they also asked
    me whether I wanted to eat something and I said yes, I would like to eat something. 
    They then gave me - I think if I recall correctly, chips and the reason why I'm
    mentioning this is that it was offered to me - the food and every time that I
    wanted to take something to eat they would bring it to my mouth and then pull
    back as soon as I wanted to bite it.   So in affect I had nothing to eat.\n\tAnd
    my further experiences as regards this interrogation were that I was hit - I
    was physically hit by Benzien and Nortje, more so by Benzien than by Nortje.  
    On that specific Sunday they had already earlier on that day, asked me whether
    I wanted to make a statement in front of a Magistrate and I said that I didn't
    want to make a statement and that I wasn't prepared to do that.  \n\tBut there
    was this one specific incident - in the process of giving them some information,
    they wanted to know from me who these people were that I was supposed to have
    met in Lesotho.  I was given instructions to carry a letter which I should not
    open until such time as I had crossed the Lesotho border and then I would find
    out who these people were and where I was supposed to meet them.  And I followed
    these instructions, I didn't open the letter.\n\tWhen I was arrested, I did away
    with the letter.  When they questioned me about this I answered them and I think
    to my regret, I said to them that I'd eaten the letter.   When I told them this,
    Benzien told me that he wanted to know who these people were that I was supposed
    to meet in Lesotho.  He then took me out of that room in the Culemborg building
    and took me to a different place, it was somewhere at the back of a building. 
    I can recall that we went past some steps and we went round the back and it was
    almost an open plan type of room.  \n\tThere he told me that I should defecate
    because he wanted to actually get this letter out of my stomach.  And whilst
    I was busy defecating he put plastic gloves, surgical gloves on his hands and
    he put his hand into my anus.  When I told him what he was doing would not get
    the letter back - when the full knowledge that I hadn't actually swallowed or
    eaten the letter, he then took a broom which was standing close by and he then
    pressed this into my anus to try and get hold of the letter.\n\tThere was very
    little which actually came out of my stomach because I hadn't had a lot to eat
    and as far as I can recall yes, there wasn't much that came out of my stomach. 
    I can't recall very specifically what period of time this was but from quite
    late that day I was really quite tired, I was very sleepy.  The interrogation
    took place during the whole of that day and it was late that night when I started
    giving out information to Benzien.  It was that night - if I recall correctly,
    that I went to point out houses belonging to my comrades. \n\tHe took me along
    specifically, he covered my head - that I can recall, when he was driving with
    me.  Furthermore when I was taken to the Sea Point police cells, I was handcuffed
    - my feet were handcuffed to the bed and basically I fell asleep because I was
    so tired.  I was forced to urinate and to defecate whilst I was so manacled to
    the bed or handcuffed to the bed.  In any event, the point I'm trying to make
    is that in that time they brought some of my comrades in there and they told
    them that I'm the one that's responsible for their arrests, that I'm the one
    that's working with them.\n\tI can clearly remember Anwar Dramat told me he was
    in my cell, I don't know about that.  But whenever they wanted to question me
    they would wake me up and take me back to Culemborg.  I think that's my experiences
    with this man Benzien.  I developed a - he installed a fear in me.  When other
    security policemen came to me I would feel more relaxed but when Benzien comes
    to me, it was difficult for me to be relaxed.  \n\tHe was the type of person
    that - he can speak to you very nicely and he can come across as the world's
    friendliest person and within a second he can change and he become and behave
    like an animal.  That's how I experienced him.\",../data/data_saha\\amnesty_hearings\\cape_town\\54671.json,761,https://sabctrc.saha.org.za/documents/amntrans/cape_town/54671.htm,911,Amnesty

    MOZIKEFANI GAMEDE,\"Okay.  In 1990 out of the unbanning of the democratic forces,
    I think in my perception as a person who was in Piet Retief at that time, I think
    the security forces, if you look in terms of the 80s, they were more involved
    with operations that were actually directed to members of the ANC.  Obviously
    the community was quite surprised in Piet Retief, you couldn't have a meeting. 
    There were a thousand procedures.\n\tActually 1989 we had the so-called election
    of the local council and us as democratic forces, I was already there in Piet
    Retief, we actually opposed the elections of the council.  It was a policy that
    as master democratic movement we actually opposed the question of the re-election
    of councillors.  But, however, people stood which meant that whoever was part
    of those elections was actually supporting the policies of the former Government
    which we didn't recognise, the Nationalist Party.  Under these circumstances,
    I think the person who got the highest vote in those elections, because we actually
    had campaigned in the community to oppose those elections, I think it was Mr
    Msibi.  I think he got about six hundred (600) votes and the others got about
    fifty two (52) and some of them were just elected unopposed, because nobody actually
    opposed them.  So, we had a council now which was formally established which
    was actually representing the Nationalist Party from 1989.  Then Mayor Mr Vilikazi
    became the Mayor and we actually campaigned as the community to say that they
    must resign as councillors because we believed that the system that they were
    representing was not representing the people of South Africa.  \n\tThen the perception
    from the community was that these people must resign and it seemed that in 1990
    when the unbanning came, the security forces had a change of strategy because
    now they were forced to have an ANC which was inside the country which was legal. 
    Now, they had to deal with an ANC which was in Piet Retief which they were not
    sure who is MK, who is what.  As we understand, that there was then an internal
    decision that was taken because it was seen that Mr Vilikazi was not actually
    enforcing the police of the Nationalist Party in order to ensure that his oppressors,
    he was given a free trip to Germany.  \n\tWhen he returned from that trip he
    was overthrown by Mr Msibi who then became the Mayor.  When he came back from
    that trip he was already removed as the Mayor of Piet Retief.  I mean it's a
    township because that time you had four councils.  So, it was the way of the
    township.  Then Msibi took over in around 1990 and that's where we actually experienced
    a lot of difficulties as communities. We couldn't hold meetings because we were
    not allowed to have meetings, to call meetings, we had to use churches because
    you will be told that the council must sit before you can get a hall and they
    are not sure when the council is going to sit.  \n\tThen in 1990, I think it
    was around March, the community obviously, because they were demanding that the
    councillors must resign, water was cut in the township.  And that's when things
    went worse in 1990, when the water was cut.  Then there was an attempt at that
    time to kidnap  myself and Councillor Thabede.  I wouldn't say, there were a
    lot of people who were injured, some were shot with rubber bullets who are still
    carrying those rubber bullets because of that situation, you know.  When they
    tried to kidnap us, unfortunately there were people around.  We then approached
    Baklender who is now the Director-General of Land Affairs.  He actually issued,
    I think that's what actually saved our lives, he issued a letter to Piet Retief
    to the commander in chief of the security branch which were actually mostly involved
    with the covert operations.  I think that's what actually tried to save our life
    at that time, but as I have mentioned, that I wouldn't count who was hurt and
    what-what.  Some students were shot in schools.  \n\tThe situation was just chaotic,
    and we then received information at that time that there was a small gang calling
    themselves PAC.  I think there was an attempt to create a gangster which, when
    we discussed with our own colleagues in Ermelo, it seems as if the same thing
    was happening where they will come up with a small gangster and that gangster
    was actually trying to destabilise the community.  In one of the community meetings,
    I think it was 1991, there was an announcement that was made by the Mayor Mr
    Msibi that he needed people who are looking for jobs, and those people were actually
    bused to Gauteng.  In Gauteng, as we believe, because most of them came back
    because they were just ... (indistinct), but they told me that they were looking
    for work.  They were actually going there to be trained.  Then around 1990/91

    AMANDLA NANGALEMBE,\"Thank you Chairman as well as the Commissioners.\n The first
    thing I am going to talk about is my brother, that was the youngest, he was the
    last born, Christopher Mpigelele Nangalembe.  I am talking about his as a member
    of the ANC's League at zone 7, they used to call it Chief Luthuli.  It is quite
    true, according to what has been said that Christopher Nangalembe was one of
    the members of the Crime Prevention Unit within the ANC and it is quite correct
    that Christopher Nangalembe used to stay at Zone 7. They were friends with Ketisi.  
    He was commonly known as \"\"The Vaal Monster\"\".\n I will just give you a brief
    outline as to Christopher Nangalembe's life before all these things took place. 
    The name 'Mpigelele', I don't know how my mother gave Mpigelele this name.  He
    used to be very persevering whenever he wanted to do something he would insist
    persevere and push forward.  Maybe if we did not - he wanted to be a policeman
    and he wanted peace amongst the community.  But even besides that, I personally
    I was against the manner in which the \nHRV/312 police/...\n3\npolice dealt with
    the community.  That was before the unbanning of the political organisations. 
    He tried to persist because his friends were policemen and they are still policemen. 
    Immediately thereafter the political organisations were banned, namely PAC and
    ANC and he was happy when this happened.  He was one of the people who were happy
    to see Mandela being released from Robben Island.  He started taking part in
    helping the community.\n On the 5th of a Saturday morning my mother received
    a phone call.  This phone call arrived at Maria's Hair Salon who is now deceased. 
    This call was telling my mother that they wanted to get Chris, if they couldn't
    get Chris they were going to kill us all and they were going to burn down the
    house.  My mother sent my sister, who comes after me, I was staying in Zone 10
    at that particular time, just behind the mountain at Small Farm, they came to
    tell me that they have received this message.  At that time, that particular
    Saturday, just the Tuesday before that Saturday after New Year there was an altercation
    amongst the comrades and Ketisi.  At that time they were trying to solve that
    problem that is besides having to shed blood, they wanted to negotiate.  Chris
    was witness in a case of an abduction. He was taken by Ketisi and Ketisi made
    him to drink acid.  Fortunately Chris went straight to Ketisi and told him straight
    that since he had done this deed he was not going to leave him alone, he was
    going to tell people that he had done this.  Probably that was the first incident
    that make Ketisi to be notorious.  And the second was all those things that Ketisi's
    mother has already related about.\n On that particular Saturday when the negotiations
    were supposed to take place I discovered that Chris was not at \nHRV/312 home/...\n4\nhome,
    he had gone to Zone 12 where he had gone to install a ceiling in a certain house. 
    At Ketisi's place there was a Granada, it's the big model.  As Chris was proceeding
    towards his customer's place these people approached him driving this Granada
    from Ketisi's place.  I think one of them was a member of the IFP.  His surname
    is Gubeka, but I've forgotten what his name is.  Just as he was approaching the
    gate this Granada accosted him.  There was Hunter inside.  There was Zanzi. 
    There was Temba.  I don't remember the last one.  Zanzi is the one who grabbed
    Chris and threw him into the car.  Somebody saw this happening, an eye witness. 
    It was at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon and during summer it's still very
    bright.  They took Chris into a certain yard, that is Ketisi's yard, that's where
    they parked the car.  As the car was still parked there somebody was sent to
    me to come and tell me that Chris was taken, as we had got the message before
    that they wanted to take Chris.  I went back home.  I also had a Colt Chrysler. 
    I drove - this Cold Chrysler was always spotted by the police but I will not
    explain as to why they wanted this car because the real matter here is about
    Chris.  When I arrived at home I told my mother that I wanted to go and see as
    to what was happening with Chris.  Just as I got to Ketisi's place it was the
    next street I came across Lucky Mboyana, he warned me not to go there because
    these people were fully armed.  I wanted to go and negotiate and find out as
    to why they had taken my brother.  I had not thought of them as being armed and
    they would want to kill me. I just wanted to know the reason behind the abduction
    of my brother.  I am really sorry that I had to mention Lucky Mboyana's name. 
    He prevented me from going there.  He said I should go to \nHRV/312 Vietnam/...\n5\nVietnam
    to fetch some comrades that I knew.  According to my recollection Adrian Vlok
    at that time was the Minister of Justice, he asked that if there's anybody who
    is having arms should be reported to the police station.  I had decided that
    I should go to the police station and be a law-abiding citizen.  I went to the
    Houtkop Police station, when I got there to report that my brother had been abducted
    and he was at Ketisi's place the police told me that they were afraid to go there. 
    They told me that if I was talking about Ketisi, Ketisi was armed to the teeth
    and they did not want to tamper with him.  These were the policemen who were
    telling me this.  These policemen were on duty on a Saturday and if they could
    be identified I could be happy because they made me a laughing stock at the time
    when I went to report this to them.  I decided to go to the comrades at Vietnam
    but somehow I was confused because I knew that there was going to be violence. 
    Now I asked them as to what I was supposed to do because they were supposed to
    be the ones who were protecting the citizens.  They told me that Ketisi and his
    friends were fully armed. \n The second thing they told me that they didn't know
    the number of the house.  They knew that it's just a house but I must bring the
    number to them.  Now I told them that if I go to seek the number I had to come
    back to the police station to furnish them with the number.  Now I went to look. 
    I saw the Granada at Ketisi's place.  You know your brother, even if it can be
    at night, I looked inside the Granada my brother was sitting inside and he was
    in the middle.  My intention was to look at the number of the house at Ketisi's
    place.  I was not able, because at that time when I was passing this Granada
    went out of the yard and \nHRV/312 tried/...\n6\ntried to follow me.  I took
    a turn at Xindi's Street, that is proceeding towards my own street. Zanzi was
    also staying at my street.  I saw the Granada following me.  I thought maybe
    they were taking Zanzi to his place.  They followed me and I went inside to tell
    my mother.  The Granada passed slowly as I went in.  At my place there's a big
    light and it's very bright.  As they turned in the Granada I saw my brother with
    my own eyes.  Maybe they had told him that he must come and bid us goodbye. 
    I was looking at my brother as he was inside the car.  I shall excuse myself
    because I've already mentioned the name of the person who was also involved who
    was in the car when my brother was being taken away. When this car took the turn
    towards the taxi rank I tried to rush out to go to my uncle and report.  My uncle
    is David Ncube.  I wanted him to phone the police and tell them that something
    had happened.   As I was going out the Granada chased me from Zone 7.  I was
    busy going around flicking to the police that they should help me because I was
    being chased by this Granada.  They never bothered to help me until I got to
    the police station, and when I got to the police station this car was following
    me and I didn't stop at the stop signs because I was scared for my life.  I thought
    that as the police had realised that there was a car chasing another one they
    should have made a follow-up.  But because it was known that it was a car that
    was sent to do its job that is why the police did not follow the car.  I got
    to the police station and at that time I was coming for the second time, I stopped
    and jumped into the police station and I said to the police I'm being chased. 
    They just looked at me as if I was mad. And at that time a third car came, that
    is the second car that was chasing me.  There HRV/312 were/...\n7\nwere three
    men inside that car, they were armed with guns.  They did not leave their guns
    where they were supposed to leave them at the reception.  They came with their
    guns and they stood beside me whilst I was complaining to the police only to
    find it was the same group that was travelling with Ketisi and they wanted to
    know what I was saying to the police at that time.  The person I was with at
    the time warned me not to continue talking because these people had come to hear
    what I was going to say.  I don't know whether the police called a riot squad
    or if the police of Vanderbijl they called them to come and take me to Vanderbijl. 
    I told them that the car had just passed, it's heading to Boipatong with my brother. 
    They were insisting that they wanted to go back to Ketisi's place and they told
    me that I must keep quiet and I must listen to them.  I was not going to give
    them a directive as to what they should do as the policemen. The riot squad came. 
    They were travelling in two vans.  They said I should escort them to Ketisi's
    place.  We went to Ketisi's place.  I was just going there because I had no alternative. 
    I thought maybe it's the procedure.  When we got there I stopped my car at the
    corner so that they might go alone.  They surrounded the house and it was pointless
    for them to have done that because Ketisi and my brother were not there as well
    as his group.  They got in there and they tried to investigate as to where Ketisi
    was. They said they don't know where Ketisi had gone to and they told me to go
    and sleep because these people were not there and they said I should come back
    the following day at the police station.  I reported this to my mother and I
    told my mother that the police refused to help me.  I went to sleep. At the time
    I was the Chairman of the HRV/312 Child/...\n8\nChild Welfare Tusonang(?) in
    Sebokeng, there was a meeting the following day that I had to attend.  When I
    was still in that meeting there's another gentleman with whom I was staying at
    Zone 10.  When he got in I could see it in his face that he was going to report
    to me that my brother had died but that did not surprise me because I was expecting
    it at any time.  When he got to me he said he had come to fetch me I should go
    home.  \n When I got home I got my mother as well as my aunt.  They had already
    got a message that Ketisi, that Chris was found at a dumping site in Boipatong. 
    Well that did not really surprise me because that is the direction they headed
    for when they had taken Chris.  I decided not to follow them in this because
    I felt that probably my mother could lose me also.  We got Chris at the dumping
    site.  He was tied, his throat was tied with a wire and this wire was twisted
    with a pair of pliers.  People saw him in the morning they could only identify
    him with his ANC card that he used to carry with.\",../data/data_saha\\human_rights_violation_hearings\\sebokeng\\55879.json,9,https://sabctrc.saha.org.za/documents/hrvtrans/sebokeng/55879.htm,13,Human

    PATRICIA MANYAMALALA,\"Thank you for being here today.  My name is Kholeka Patricia
    Manyamalala, I am a lady teacher in Hector Pietersen.  My husband is Thandabantu
    Manyamalala, we got married in 1977.  We were in Transkei by the time, we got
    married in Kokstad on the 25th of September 1977.  We had three children.  Two
    girls and a boy.  In Transkei Thandabantu was a public prosecutor.  Due to certain
    circumstances we decided to come to Johannesburg to join our family, the Manyamalala
    family, because most of the family\nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 K P MANYAMALALA\nmembers
    of Manyamalala are in Gauteng.  When we arrived here he was working for Stannic. 
    He didn't work there for a long time. He was working for the SABC.  He used to
    like going to church, his congregation was Presbyterian Church Southern Africa.
    He was an elder there.  \n In the beginning of my story of his death.  On the
    8th of September 1991, it was on a Sunday evening, Sunday evening.  I wasn't
    at home, because we are staying in Fullers in Kagiso. He was left at home with
    our younger child who is four years old. I was with the other one, the second
    born.  The eldest one was in Kokstad boarding school.   The people came to fetch
    me, the family members, telling me that my husband had died.  The manner of his
    death, when the people told me, the person who was with him and from the information
    that I got from the newspapers, as I have already told you. I will go back again
    a little bit.   He used to like his church. He was an elder in the Presbyterian
    Church.  By that time the shacks in Muchanga Village were burnt, people didn't
    have a place to stay.  Even right in church there were people who needed some
    assistance. On that particular day when he was from church, he was with another
    woman to fetch that woman's property.  He was going to take his furniture to
    a place where he got a place to stay. When they were on their way on that particular
    day, there was a rally in Jabulani Amphiteatre, an IFP rally.  It is said that
    while he was driving from Fuller down to Crossroads, the people who were in that
    particular rally, the IFP people, it was already in the evening, the rally was
    over.  They were escorted by the police, police Casspirs.  As they were driving
    down to Crossroads, they saw a group of people in Crossroads, people SOWETO HEARING
    TRC/GAUTENG\n3 K P MANYAMALALA\nof this rally.  They were approaching this group
    of people from the rally when they were next to (indistinct), he just decided
    to make a U-turn to go back to avoid the group of people who were approaching.
    Unfortunately there were other people who were already out of his group which
    was being escorted by the police.  They were from Shangu Village, the direction
    of Shangu Village.  They shot at her. He couldn't get control over the car and
    the car came to a standstill.  They were there already, within a short time,
    a group of people were there.  Four them, or the men who were there, it is said
    that they are the people who killed him. When he stopped the car, they pelted
    the car with stones.  They opened the door of the car, they took him out of the
    car.  When I was identifying him in the mortuary, he was hit by a knobkierie
    on his forehead and his clothes that he was wearing.  He had a lot of wounds.
    There was another one that I think it was the worst wound, which was on his ribs. 
    I don't even know whether it was a spear or if it was a knife. There was no bullet
    wound.  You could see that they used spears or knives to stab him.  What is hurting,
    when I was reading the newspapers, because this thing was published in the Nation
    newspaper and in the Sowetan. When I - and from the witness also that had the
    information.  Fortunately there were journalists from Sowetan who were following
    the car who actually saw everything. It is said that those people, the people
    who were in that mob, in that group of people from the rally, or IFP people,
    they managed to stop the car and drag him out of the car and beat him and stabbed
    him.  But all that time police couldn't come to his rescue. \n Secondly, the
    people who were doing all those things, it is obvious that they had weapons,
    because he had stab\nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 K P MANYAMALALA\nwounds. 
    They could take those people and with their weapons and arrest them, but unfortunately
    they didn't do that.   After that the police Casspirs, as I was told, the police
    were in those Casspirs.  They spread tear-gas to disperse the mob.  A lot of
    people died in Crossroads and Mfulu on that particular day.  Because these people,
    the IFP people were killing randomly.  It was a Sunday evening, people were coming
    from their churches and others were coming from their community societies.  But
    there was - the help was not sufficient because the people died.  \n When I was
    told this in Kagiso, I was very shocked. It was the time that people were being
    killed in large numbers by the IFP.\n After the funeral I tried to make a statement
    in Protea police station.  When I arrived there, I was not satisfied the way
    they treated me.  Because we were told, even my relatives were also told, that
    all those cases of that particular day, they are still investigating them.  There
    is no evidence which is enough, which was enough.  I waited that maybe I will
    get a letter or something which will be summoning me to the case from the police
    station or whatever.  But till today I never got anything. There was no evidence.
    I don't have knowledge, I am still in the dark.\",../data/data_saha\\human_rights_violation_hearings\\soweto\\55920.json,5,https://sabctrc.saha.org.za/documents/hrvtrans/soweto/55920.htm,7,Human

    Thank you.  The station commander of the time used to visit me at the cell. 
    He was visiting me, he wanted to convince me to leave what I was doing, to join
    the force, the police force.  I informed him that I was not interested in politics,
    and he explained the history of my father, which I doubt he knew at all.  Now
    I remember one night in July - I don't remember the date because it was during
    this 90 days of detention.  That is where they undressed me and they grabbed
    me by my penis and they put - the took the mattress off the bed and they tied
    me on the bed with the handcuffs and they chained my legs too.  I remember at
    all times my legs were spread.  I did not even have an underwear because I was
    really naked.  There was an equipment applied to my private parts.  I do not
    remember what I told them that day, because when I woke up I was unchained, I
    was lying on the floor naked as I was, and they asked me, \"\"Do you still refuse
    that you went to that place for training and firearms?\"\" and I negated that,
    because it is true I didn't go for any training, I wanted to learn as any other
    school child.  That night I was taken - that was after they have electrocuted
    me I was taken to a bridge called Henniston Bridge.  This is a bridge between
    Orange Free State and the Cape, and it has got the Orange River.  I do not know,
    but I read that that is the highest bridge in South Africa.  There was a bag
    where they put letters by the post office people.  I was assaulted by those people. 
    I was put inside this bag and then it was tightened.  I never thought that that
    bag can afford to carry a person as tall as myself.  You know, I was standing
    and this bag reached my head.  There was a van.  I can't remember the name they
    used to give to that van, but we used to call it a 4x4.  It was a Mercedes Benz
    van, and at the front it has got a chain.  It is used to pull.  That is where
    they held me, and I was put down into the river, the Orange River.  They put
    me the third time, and when they put me down for the fourth time that is when
    I felt that they were now putting me in the water.  I prayed to my God.  I said,
    \"\"God, if I don't have any chance to unchain myself please help me,\"\" because
    I was chained behind my back.  I was still naked, and they pulled me out.  That
    was the fifth time, if not the sixth time.  They put me on top of the bridge
    and they were asking me, \"\"Don't you want to tell the truth still?\"\"  Policemen
    who were there they were white policemen who I cannot remember, and where they
    came from, but I think they were members of the Special Branch from Bloemfontein. 
    Now, the black people were there.  Sergeant Mpakathi was there.  He was a sergeant
    at that time.  Sergeant Simano was there.  He was already a sergeant at that
    time.  And the other one was Pitso's father.  We called him Mthathaki Pitso. 
    Then his surname is Moghele.  They tried to assault me, and they wanted to convince
    me that my life at home can change because my mother was the only breadwinner. 
    My brother and my sister were already in their homes.  They were married.  During
    the torture I came to a conclusion.  If I have to struggle this way and let my
    mother struggle I'd better die in their hands.  Now, I took a decision to run
    for my life, and run into the river, down the cliff, and die.  This was not an
    easy decision.  My body was hurting.  All my body was hurting.  And I tried to
    do just that decision.  I ran, and at the end of the bridge, when I was just
    about to hold the bridge to jump, Sergeant Mpakathi was on my heels and he pulled
    me off.  I don't know what he used, but he used his hands.  Whether fists or
    not I do not know.  He asked me what was my intention.  I told him that I wanted
    to kill myself because I do not know what truth do they want from me because
    I gave them the only truth.  Because it was not yet the end of my detention they
    took me back to the cell.  I stayed in the cell for a few days.  That was before
    I was taken to Dr Buys.  I requested help from Dr Buys because I was not eating
    any more in the cell, and I said I wanted to see a doctor.  I requested help. 
    I wanted him to examine me thoroughly.  He gave me medication and tablets, which
    I was supposed to take immediately.  When I arrived in the cell I could not walk. 
    Now, the prison warder was now escorting me into the cell.  After some time this
    medication was really working in me.  I sat in the cell.  I woke up, and when
    I woke up the food was next to me.  I could not hold myself because I was so
    hungry, because this was now the fifth day without food.  I ate that food, and
    after two days I was taken to the other political prisoners.  This went on for
    some time, but I liked one thing, you know, I got a chance to study in the cell,
    and that was the only time I used to study, and I passed in 1988.  In 1989, when
    I was doing matric ... (inaudible - end of Side A, Tape 5) ... was my mother. 
    My mother could not bear the burden any more, because I was a trouble and the
    police were the trouble.  I know I troubled her because I was her child, but
    now the trouble from the police was an extra burden.  As a parent she was not
    supposed to have been treated that way.  She was supposed to be a well-respected
    person.  And in 1989 in February I was taken under the state of emergency and
    I was taken to a farm and I was put in the water.  I do not remember whether
    did they have any kind of an animal with them, but I remember when I got out
    of the water that is where a cat was put.  Every time when I was hit I had this
    problem of passing out.  On that day I had an underwear with me.  Luckily, because
    I was not cuffed, they put a cat.  Because I was cold and I was folding my body
    they put the cat behind me, and it stayed on my back.  I tried to fight it, but
    luckily I killed it while inside this sack.  When I got out of the bag I had
    to go back into that water, the water in the dam.  It was a muddy area, but I
    could not - I could not run away from that mud.  I had to walk on the mud, but
    luckily I fainted and some of them pulled me out quickly.  I remember this water
    was deep to my - just below my breast, my chest.  I do not remember whether I
    fell on my back or I fell on my face. (Inaudible) ... farm that you spoke about?  
    ---   If I explain it I think it's on the way to Smithfield.  That is from Bethulie. 
    Today I still suspect that one of the two farms is the one where I was taken
    to, because the dams on those two farms are alike, they are the same.\",../data/data_saha\\human_rights_violation_hearings\\ladybrand\\56231.json,482,https://sabctrc.saha.org.za/documents/hrvtrans/ladybrand/56231.htm,492,Human
